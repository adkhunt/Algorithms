	-- Auto complete suggestion using trie data structure --

	This program will read the file passed with the command 
	and read that file word by word and insert each word into 
	trie structure and also store the count of that word occur 
	in the file. trie is the efficient data structure to store 
	the word and easy to search in trie structure.

	when you type any word it will auto detect the keyboard hit 
	and change the output of matching prefix spells with the word 
	count.
